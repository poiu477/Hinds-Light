This is a Next.js (App Router) frontend for a Hebrew-language news/social feed automatically translated to English.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing from `src/app/page.tsx`.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Environment

- `API_URL` â€“ backend base URL used by the server-side proxy (default `http://localhost:4000`).
